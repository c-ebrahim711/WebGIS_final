    "text": "What can Trees Do for People?\n\nTrees provide numerous benefits to people, including:\n\nImproving Air Quality – Trees absorb pollutants (like CO₂, ozone, and particulate matter) and release oxygen.\nReducing Urban Heat – They provide shade and cool the air through evapotranspiration, lowering energy costs.\nEnhancing Mental Health – Exposure to trees reduces stress and improves overall well-being.\nBoosting Property Values – Homes near trees often have higher market values.\nReducing Flooding – Tree roots absorb rainwater, decreasing runoff and erosion.\nSupporting Wildlife – Trees provide habitats for birds, insects, and other urban wildlife.\nEncouraging Physical Activity – Green spaces promote walking, jogging, and outdoor recreation.\n\n\n\n\nHow Is Income Related to Trees in NYC?\n\nIn New York City, tree distribution is often linked to income levels:\n\nWealthier Neighborhoods Have More Trees – Areas like the Upper East Side and Park Slope have higher tree canopy coverage compared to lower-income areas.\nEnvironmental Inequality – Lower-income neighborhoods (e.g., parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn) tend to have fewer trees, leading to higher heat island effects and poorer air quality.\nCity Initiatives – NYC’s MillionTreesNYC program (2007-2015) aimed to increase tree equity, but disparities remain.\nHealth & Economic Impacts – Less tree cover in low-income areas can worsen health outcomes (e.g., asthma rates) and reduce property values."
